        <h1>Best game ever</h1>
        <h2>CS:GO</h2>
        <p>CS:GO stands for Counter Strike Global Offensive. It's a First person shooter game developed by an American Company named Valve. The beta release of CSGO was in 2011 and the official release of CSGO was in 2012. It brought two communities as CS:S and CS:1.6 together with the next generation features of the game. Now it's one of the most played videos games in steam history.</p>
        <p>You're gonna have to argue that aggression won't lead to learned violence. The social-learning perspective on the frustration-aggression theory says that aggression is a learned response to frustration. If frustration occurs over the course of playing CS (Frustration is caused by blocking of perceived valued goals; if your goal is to win and you keep losing/dying then it will likely lead to frustration) then aggression may follow if one has learned to respond to frustration that way. Usually, this is harmless and short lived and generally involves a bit of swearing or banging on the desk or something. This aggression can also come from any game that is perceived as frustrating, not just violent ones.

            Violent games just tend to have this associated with them more often since violent games tend to me more challenging and thus more often perceived as frustrating.
            
            This is an example of a normal amount of aggression people display on a day to day basis. The people who have homicidal incidents are much more unique cases than this, and are certainly a minority among people who play games.
            
            You may want to argue against Bandura's theories. His work is largely the reason why people think violent games can be bad. He did an experiment with a bobo doll. Basically a child viewed an adult beat a bobo doll, and then when they were alone in the same room as it they decided to beat it too[Edit: Im being very general here since I'm pressed for time, so I encourage you to look up the experiment.]. So people figure it's possible that with videogames there's a "monkey-see-monkey-do" kind of thing going on. However, most people who do play fps games don't actually ever pick up a gun in real life.
            
            Some good terms to look up for your paper are "priming" and "modelling." Good luck!!</p>
